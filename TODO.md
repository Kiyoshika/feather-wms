# TODO Dev List
Things I need to do in no particular order:
* Introduce a standard set of ERROR codes to use when throwing exceptions. E.g., `ERR-100: Location already exists.`
* Create fwms client (in separate folder) to interact with fwms core (the "server" code)
* Add a logger to indicate certain actions (e.g., inserting a new location, attempting to insert duplication location, etc.)
